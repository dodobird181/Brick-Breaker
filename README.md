### Goals
After growing up playing Atari's "Breakout" on an old Asus flip-phone during long car rides with  my sister, and hearing about what it was possible to create using
HTML5's Canvas element, I became slightly ambitious (having no prior Javascript experience) and decided to create my own version of Brick-Breaker!

I had multiple goals for this project. The first among them being to successfully learn Javascript (hooray!), as well as to discover and utilize Javascript "best-practices" 
during my development.

*  Create a game that is visually appealing.
*  Use sound effects / music.
*  Stick to / discover best practices in Javascript development.
*  Write well-documented and intelligible code.
*  

### On what can be improved


### Acknowledgements
I am in debt to Yann Sartori, who inspired me to learn Javacript with his version of [Pacman](https://github.com/yannsartori/Pac-Man), and
Patrick de Arteaga, who provided the [royalty-free music](https://patrickdearteaga.com/) for my version of Brick-Breaker.
