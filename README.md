# Brick-Breaker
Created a simplified version of the classic "Breakout" arcade game (Brick-Breaker).

### Goals
After growing up playing Atari's "Breakout" on an old Asus flip-phone during long car rides with  my sister, and hearing about what it was possible to create using
HTML5's Canvas element, I became slightly ambitious (having no prior Javascript experience) and decided to create my own version of Brick-Breaker!

I had multiple goals for this project. The first among them being to successfully learn Javascript (hooray!), as well as implement an easy to use [Level-Editing System](https://github.com/dodobird181/Brick-Breaker/blob/main/src/level_loader.js) (of which I am particularily proud). 

**Additionally, I aspired to do the following**:
*  Create a game that is visually appealing.
*  Use sound effects / music throughout the game.
*  Get better at HTML & CSS (this included learning [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)!)
*  Implement particle effects.
*  Give the game a menu-screen / level-selection, etc.

### On what can be improved


### Acknowledgements
I am in debt to Yann Sartori, who inspired me to learn Javacript with his version of [Pacman](https://github.com/yannsartori/Pac-Man), and
Patrick de Arteaga, who provided the [royalty-free music](https://patrickdearteaga.com/) for my version of Brick-Breaker.
