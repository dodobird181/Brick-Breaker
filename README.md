# Brick-Breaker
Created a simplified version of the classic "Breakout" arcade game (Brick-Breaker), which can be viewed/played online here: https://dodobird181.github.io/Brick-Breaker/.

### Goals
After growing up playing Atari's "Breakout" on an old Asus flip-phone during long car rides with  my sister, and hearing about what it was possible to create using
HTML5's Canvas element, I became slightly ambitious (having no prior Javascript experience) and decided to create my own version of Brick-Breaker!

I had multiple goals for this project. The first among them being to successfully learn Javascript (hooray!), as well as implement an easy to use [Level-Editing System](https://github.com/dodobird181/Brick-Breaker/blob/main/src/level_loader.js) (of which I am particularily proud). 

*Additionally, I wanted to make sure that I:*
*  Created a game that is visually appealing.
*  Used sound effects / music throughout the game.
*  Got better at HTML & CSS (this included learning [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)!)
*  Implemented particle effects.
*  Gave the game a menu-screen / level-selection, etc.

### On what can be improved
Because a project like Brick-Breaker is composed of many moving-parts, there are inevitably some things that I didn't have time for, and which could be improved.

*Specifically, I would like to:*
*  Add a variety of power-ups to the game.
*  Implement a browser-cache "Level unlocking feature" that remembers player progress through the levels (even after page-reload).
*  ~~Add a menu "background-display" to make the menu-screens feel more lively.~~

*And regarding the known bugs:*
*  Fix ball moving through and breaking multiple bricks if lined up perfectly with brick-edges.
*  ~~Fix the mysterious "2-heart, game-over" bug (which I believe has been patched, but is difficult to text exhaustively).~~
*  ~~Fix accidental brick deletion from array on ball collision.~~

### Acknowledgements
I am in debt to Yann Sartori, who inspired me to learn Javacript with his version of [Pacman](https://github.com/yannsartori/Pac-Man), and
Patrick de Arteaga, who provided the [royalty-free music](https://patrickdearteaga.com/) for my version of Brick-Breaker.
